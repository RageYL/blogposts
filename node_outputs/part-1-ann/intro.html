				<h1>introduction</h1>
<p>Want to understand machine learning by looking at nice pictures instead of
boring math ? Want to learn how to use it to develop real applications in a few
lines of code ? This series is for you !</p>
<h2>applications</h2>
<p>Let's begin with a wikipedia definition of machine learning: (TODO)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the
ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It allows machines to perform very complex tasks until now unreachable. Its
applications seems limitless and already produce mind-blowing results. So,
what's better to get you interested than to show you what you can do with it ?</p>
<p>TODO: css, better usages &amp; better pictures and video (robots, generative models,
, image to image, agi ?), can do/will be able to</p>
<ul>
<li>save lives by making medical diagnostics</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are just few examples: there is no limit ! And the field is growing so
fast new applications are released every week !</p>
<p>I hope it piqued your interest and without further ado, let's see how it works !</p>
<h2>big picture</h2>
<p>Machine learning is a bit like a programmer: it's used to create functions. You
begin by creating some kind of magic box: a machine learning model.</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/big-picture-model-only.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>If you give it some data (images, texts, sounds, spreadsheets, sensor values, ...)
it gives you something in return.</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/big-picture-model-forward.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>But at first, it has no idea what you expect it to return</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/big-picture-model-init.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Fortunately, it can learn. Either by itself (unsupervised learning) or by
being taught (supervised learning). Let's see the later in more details.</p>
<h2>supervised learning</h2>
<p>Supervised learning is similar to how you would teach a child. Imagine you have
some images representing animals (cats, dogs, birds...). You show him a random
picture and ask him what animal he thinks it is.</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/supervised-predict.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>If he got it wrong, you correct him</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/supervised-correct.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>If he got it right, you reward him</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/supervised-reward.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Repeat this long enought and he will eventually learn to recognize animals.</p>
<p>The key point of supervised learning is that you must have the answers to the
questions you ask.</p>
<h2>classification</h2>
<p>While machine learning can be used to tackle very different problems, we will
only perform classification tasks in this post. The objective of such tasks is
to predict to which categories belongs the input data.</p>
<p>An example would be lung cancer detection: given a 3d scan, you must predict if
the patient is suffering from cancer or not:</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/cancer-classes.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>You can also have problems that have more than one categories. For instance, if
you want to know which animals are represented in a pictures, you can have one
class per kind of animals:</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/animal-classes.png" alt=""></figure>
<h2>project</h2>
<p>In this post, our objective will be to learn, step by step, how to create a
system capable of recognizing handwritten digits. The system will work as
follows: we input an image</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/project-input.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>And the model predict which digit is represented in the image.</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/project-output.png" alt=""></figure>
<h2>images</h2>
<p>As we will be working with images, let's learn a bit more about them.</p>
<p>An image is composed of small colored squares, called pixels. Each pixel is
represented by a number which define its filling color. Here is an example with
huge pixels:</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/image-as-pixels.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>In this image:</p>
<ul>
<li>a white pixel is represented by a 1</li>
<li>a black pixel is represented by a 0</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of keeping this post as simple as possible, we will be using images
comprised of black and white pixels only in all our examples.</p>
<figure><img src="/node_outputs/part-1-ann/images-js/pixels-01.png" alt=""></figure>
<p>Now that the introduction is over, let the fun begin !</p>

<div class="box box-important">
<p>Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that those posts are here to give a high
level understanding of machine learning. I tried hard to make the content
accessible to as many people as possible, but the post is long and dense. if you
feel you don't understand everything, do not give up and continue reading. Most
of the content is here to give you an intuition about how things work and is not
mandatory to understand what's follow. None of the maths presented here are
important !</p>
